            <h2>What Is Weekend for Good?</h2>
            <p>Weekend for Good is the ripple effect in action: it’s a weekend-long event of technology and design volunteers donating their time, creating custom technology tools and solutions for non-profit agencies. In turn, those agencies create meaningful change here in Grand Rapids and around the globe.</p>
            <p>Web developers, designers, and strategists work together to amplify each non-profit’s mission, supporting the ever-widening reach of agencies’ good work.</p>
